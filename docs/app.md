# App Functions Documentation

This file documents all functions in `app.js` - the application entry point.

## Functions

### `initializeGame()`

Initializes the game when the DOM content is loaded. Sets up game instances and creates the initial game board.

**Parameters:** None

**Return Value:** `void`

**Description:**
- Creates instances of GameLogic, UI, and Storage classes
- Passes dependencies between classes
- Calls UI initialization to create the game board

**Example:**
```javascript
// Called automatically when DOM is loaded
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initializeGame);
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- This is the main entry point of the application
- Ensures all DOM elements are available before initialization
- Sets up the dependency injection pattern between classes

### Event Listeners

#### `DOMContentLoaded` Event Listener

**Parameters:**
- `event` (Event): The DOM content loaded event

**Return Value:** `void`

**Description:**
Waits for the DOM to be fully loaded before initializing the game to ensure all HTML elements are available for manipulation.

**Example:**
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initializeGame);
```

## Module Dependencies

- `GameLogic` class from `gameLogic.js`
- `UI` class from `ui.js`
- `Storage` class from `storage.js`

## Architecture Flow

1. Browser loads HTML and JavaScript files
2. `DOMContentLoaded` event fires
3. `initializeGame()` function executes
4. Game classes are instantiated with proper dependencies
5. UI creates initial game board
6. Application is ready for user interaction
