## Architecture

### Modular Design

The application follows a modular architecture with separated concerns:

#### `app.js` - Application Entry Point
- Initializes the game when DOM is loaded
- Creates instances of GameLogic and UI classes
- Sets up the initial game board

#### `gameLogic.js` - Game Mechanics
- **GameLogic Class**: Core game functionality
  - Board state management
  - Player turn handling
  - Win condition checking
  - Score tracking
  - Settings validation

#### `ui.js` - User Interface
- **UI Class**: DOM manipulation and event handling
  - Dynamic board generation
  - Event listeners for user interactions
  - Display updates and visual feedback
  - Form handling for game settings

#### `storage.js` - Data Persistence
- **Storage Class**: LocalStorage operations
  - Save/load game scores
  - Save/load game state
  - Clear stored data
